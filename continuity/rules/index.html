                <h2>How to Play</h2>
                <p>In Continuity, players must submit words that start with the last letter of the current word displayed on the screen. Each submitted word must be unique, valid, and meet the letter continuity requirement to proceed to the next word.</p>

                <h2>Basic Rules</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>The current word is displayed on the screen. Your task is to guess a word that starts with the last letter of the current word.</li>
                    <li>Use the on-screen keyboard or your physical keyboard to type in the guess.</li>
                    <li>Words must be valid according to the game's dictionary.</li>
                    <li>After submitting a word, it cannot be reused in future rounds.</li>
                    <li>Each valid word submission will increase your score, which is based on the length of the word.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Time Limit</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>You have a time limit for each guess, starting at 30 seconds.</li>
                    <li>The time limit decreases by 0.25 seconds for every valid word you submit, down to a minimum of 10 seconds.</li>
                    <li>If you don't submit a word before the timer runs out, the game will end.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Objectives</h2>
                <p>Your goals in Continuity are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Submit as many valid words as possible without running out of time.</li>
                    <li>Keep improving your score to surpass your high score.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Scoring</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Each word adds to your score based on its length. Longer words yield more points.</li>
                    <li>Track your score at the top of the game screen, alongside your high score.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Last 10 Words</h2>
                <p>The last 10 words you've used are displayed on the screen for reference. You cannot reuse these words in future rounds.</p>

                <h2>Tips</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Plan your words ahead of time based on the last letter of the current word.</li>
                    <li>Try to use longer words to maximize your score.</li>
                    <li>Manage your time wisely by submitting valid words quickly.</li>
                </ul>
