                <h2>How to Play</h2>
                <p>In WordForge, your goal is to create valid words from a random pool of letters. Each letter has a cooldown, and you must strategically build your words while managing the cooldowns. The more words you create, the more points you score!</p>

                <h2>Rules</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Create valid words by clicking on the letters in the pool.</li>
                    <li>Once you submit a word, the letters used will enter cooldown and cannot be reused until the cooldown ends.</li>
                    <li>Your score is based on the length of the words you submit. Longer words score higher.</li>
                    <li>Every 10 words submitted, a letter is removed from the pool until the minimum number of letters is reached.</li>
                    <li>If a word is invalid, it will not be accepted and your word progress will reset.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Objectives</h2>
                <p>Your primary objectives are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Submit as many valid words as possible.</li>
                    <li>Keep your score increasing to beat your high score.</li>
                    <li>Manage your available letters efficiently to maximize your word-building potential.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Scoring</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Each valid word you submit adds to your score. The score is calculated based on word length.</li>
                    <li>Track your progress with the progress bar, which resets after every 10 words submitted.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Tips</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use vowels and common consonants wisely to create longer words.</li>
                    <li>Plan your next words while managing letter cooldowns effectively.</li>
                    <li>Try to submit longer words for higher scores, but be mindful of cooldowns.</li>
                </ul>
