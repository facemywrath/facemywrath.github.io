                <h2>Objective</h2>
                <p>In Wordle, your goal is to guess a secret 5-letter word within 6 attempts. After each guess, you'll receive feedback on how close your guess was to the correct word.</p>

                <h2>Basic Rules</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Each word you guess must be a valid 5-letter word from the game's word list.</li>
                    <li>After each guess, the letters will be color-coded based on their correctness:
                        <ul>
                            <li><span class="correct">Green</span>: Correct letter in the correct position.</li>
                            <li><span class="present">Yellow</span>: Correct letter but in the wrong position.</li>
                            <li><span class="absent">Grey</span>: Letter not present in the word.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>You have 6 attempts to guess the correct word. If you fail, the game will reveal the correct word.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Keyboard</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>You can either use the on-screen keyboard or your physical keyboard to input guesses.</li>
                    <li>As you play, the keys on the keyboard will also change color to help you remember which letters you've already used and how they performed in your previous guesses.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Scoring</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your score is based on how many guesses you used. The fewer guesses, the higher your score.</li>
                    <li>If you guess the word on your first try, you'll receive the maximum score of 6 points.</li>
                    <li>If you lose, your score resets to zero.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Tips</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Start with a word that contains common letters to maximize your chances of uncovering key letters early.</li>
                    <li>Pay close attention to the letter colors after each guess, and adjust your strategy accordingly.</li>
                </ul>
